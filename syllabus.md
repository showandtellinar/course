cs6501: "Show-and-Tell"
=======================

**Meetings:** Mondays and Wednesdays, 11am-12:15pm in Rice 536.  

**Coordinator:** [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans)

Plan
====

This course will run differently from a traditional course (lectures) or
graduate seminar (paper discussions).  The goal is for this course to be
more like a "show-and-tell" than a traditional seminar.

The course will be an "open" course, with everyone sharing code, data,
and notes through a [github organization site](https://github.com/dataseminar).
