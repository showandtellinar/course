cs6501: "Show-and-Tell"-inar
=============================

**Meetings:** Mondays and Wednesdays, 11am-12:15pm in Rice 536.  

**Coordinator:** [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans)

## Plan

This course will run differently from a traditional course (lectures) or
graduate seminar (paper discussions).  The goal is for this course to be
more like a "show-and-tell" than a traditional seminar.

The course will be an "open" course, with everyone sharing code, data,
and notes through a [github organization
site](https://github.com/dataseminar).  Meetings will be focused around
particular questions that can be answered by collecting and analyzing
data, as well as building interesting services that use or develop data
sets.

## Expected Background

The course is listed as a graduate-level seminar, but is open to any
students who are both able to contribute well to the seminar and likely
to get something worthwhile out of participating in it.  Although no
particular technical background is required, students should be
self-motivated learners who are comfortable with programming and eager
to share things they learn with others.

## Activities

Most course meeting will run as a "show-and-tell", where each
participant will tell the class about what you did and show some
interesting results.  Students can work in small teams (or even a full
team of the whole class) to combine efforts and share results.

We will focus our efforts by selecting for each meeting (or multiple
weeks) either (1) some specific data set, (2) some particular question,
or (3) some technical approach (or perhaps a combination of two or more
of these).  

## Goals

The class should produce some things of value beyond just our class.

The class meetings should be interesting and fun for everyone.

Everyone in the class will learn some interesting new things.
